# Project README

## Project Overview

This GitHub repository showcases a part of my contributions to a larger project. Due to proprietary concerns and intellectual property considerations, a significant portion of the codebase has been removed from this public repository. The purpose of this repository is to present a concise and sanitized representation of my work that can be included in my resume and shared with potential employers or collaborators.

## Removed Code

The decision to remove code was primarily driven by the need to protect sensitive information and proprietary code owned by the organization I worked for. As an ethical developer, I must respect the company's rights to their intellectual property and comply with any legal or contractual obligations.

## What is Included

In this repository, you will find a carefully selected subset of the original project codebase that highlights the specific contributions I made during my involvement in the project. While this may limit the visibility of the entire project's scope, it allows me to demonstrate my technical abilities, coding style, problem-solving skills, and proficiency with the technologies used in the project.

## Contributions

The remaining code in this repository represents a diverse set of features and functionalities that I implemented. The code is well-documented, and I have made an effort to provide clear explanations in the comments to help readers understand the context and purpose of each module.

## How to Use This Repository

Since this repository only includes a fraction of the original project's codebase, it cannot be used to run the entire application. It is meant for demonstration purposes only.

If you have any specific questions or would like to know more about the work I've done, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I'd be more than happy to discuss my contributions and provide additional insights.

## Final Note

I would like to thank you for taking the time to review this repository and consider my work. I hope this selection of code provides a glimpse of my skills and experience as a developer. I look forward to any potential opportunities and welcome any feedback you may have.

Please remember that this repository serves only as a snapshot of my work and does not represent the entirety of my professional capabilities.

Thank you again for your interest!

Sincerely,
Rodz Andrie Amor
